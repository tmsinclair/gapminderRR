Gapminder fights devastating misconceptions about global development. Gapminder produces free teaching resources making the world understandable based on **reliable statistics**. Gapminder promotes a fact-based worldview everyone can understand.  Gapminder collaborates with universities, UN, public agencies and non-governmental organizations. - [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/about-gapminder/) (2018)

>The gapminder project is a **non-profit** venture registered in Stockholm, Sweden, that promotes sustainable global development and achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by increased use and understanding of statistics and other information about social, economic and environmental development at local, national and global levels. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gapminder_Foundation) (2018)
